# Roadmap
1.create an empty folder and prompt the AI to create a Next.js project

2.create a `.cursorrules` file, paste the prepared content in it, create a session called *ScratchPad*, and prompt the AI to generate the development steps with the following prompt
```
Create development steps in `Scratchpad` of `.cursorrules` to create an ecommerce website with admin dashboard like amazon using TypeScript, Next.js 15, Shadcn, Lucide, Zod, Zustand, Recharts, Resend, Uploadthing, Prisma, PostgreSQL, next-auth@beta, Stripe.
```

3.prompt the AI to install all the dependencies written under the *ScratchPad* step. Only installing, no configuration

4.we got the project ready, test it if everything is fine. If so, milestone checked.
